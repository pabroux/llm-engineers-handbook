# LLM Engineer's Handbook

This is a copy of the official repository [LLM Engineer's Handbook](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook) by [Paul Iusztin](https://github.com/iusztinpaul) and [Maxime Labonne](https://github.com/mlabonne). The only difference is that I replaced [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) and its [poe the poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) plugin with [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi).
